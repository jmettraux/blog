## patterns at Hiroshima Lightning Talks

I gave a lightning talk about patterns at the [Hiroshima Lightning Talks](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LT%E9%A7%86%E5%8B%95) gathering.

I started by showing my [GR1 ruck](http://www.goruck.com/gr1-explained) and pitching the two "patterns" it sports that are important for me:

* **Laptop compartment** separate from main compartment
* **Lays completely flat** and opens almost like a suitcase

<div style="padding: 1em 0;"><img src="images/20160905_gr1_laptop.jpg" style="width: 49%; display: inline-block;" /><img src="images/20160905_gr1_flat.jpg" style="width: 49%; display: inline-block;" /></div>

I then went further and switched to software patterns and the well known [Elements of Reusable Objected-Oriented Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns), from there I shew two further books but then switched to the origin of the patterns in the [Pattern Language](https://www.patternlanguage.com/) movement (some say "permatecture").

Some people with only peripheral knowledge of programming think that only the GoF book exists and that quizzing a programmer about them is a valid "interview" technique. Some of the patterns in there are object-oriented language specific and when you dwell back in functional programming (back from computer techniques into science), those patterns are gone with the wind. The patterns in the [books](https://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Enterprise-Application-Architecture-Martin/dp/0321127420/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1473035195&sr=1-1&keywords=patterns+of+enterprise+application+architecture) [beyond](https://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Integration-Patterns-Designing-Deploying/dp/0321200683/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1473035195&sr=1-3&keywords=patterns+of+enterprise+application+architecture) that book are more important.

Here are the slides, they are rough, they were only pillars to my talk.

The building picture are from the [Eishin Campus](http://eishin.ac/about_campus.php) that Christopher Alexander with and for the teachers and students there.

My rucksack was the first point of the talk because it contained all the books described in the talk, I could then hand the books to the participants and let them get a feel for the volumes.

Among the Christopher Alexander books, my current favourite is [A Pattern Language](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Language-Buildings-Construction-Environmental/dp/0195019199/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1473035366&sr=1-1&keywords=a+pattern+language), I get lost in it, trying to absorb the wisdom it distils. As a programmer I love to grow interesting, useful, nice pieces of sofware, but I also crave for places where I can sit or stand and let that growing happen.

There is a great [documentary about Christopher Alexander](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhmm2Ld9VqQ) on YouTube: "Life cannot be produced from a drawing, life can only be produced from a process" (minute 3:40).
