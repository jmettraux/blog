## chruby in Hiroshima

Back in June, I presented about [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) and [ruby-install](https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install) at [Hiroshima.rb #056](https://hiroshimarb.connpass.com/event/58400/). My slides are available on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/jmettraux/chruby).

Yesterday, Nishimoto-san explored chruby and wrote a blog post about it: [https://ja.nishimotz.com/chruby](https://ja.nishimotz.com/chruby). I like how he went further, installing a Ruby version manually, placing it in `/opt/rubies/ruby-2.4.1` so that `chruby` sees it and then tasked himself with installing the Yard gem for this new Ruby.

My next step after installing a Ruby is to do `gem install bundler` and then I don't touch `gem` much, except when pushing a Ruby gem out (I have `gem build` and `gem push` wrapped in a `make push` at [that point](https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler/blob/d7028c2a849f782cba0bb0bf3e4260c524d6775c/Makefile#L16-L22)).

Thanks to [Nishimoto-san](https://en.nishimotz.com/) for this post, full of hints.
