## Hiroshima.rb #058

Yesterday's evening we had [Hiroshima.rb #058](https://hiroshimarb.connpass.com/event/65459/) at the Basset Caf√© in West Hiroshima.

Due to the [Rubykaigi 2017](http://rubykaigi.org/2017), we had paused for two months. We hope to go on with one Hiroshima.rb meeting per month.

[Furukido-san](https://twitter.com/pecosantoyobe) wrote [his own report](https://scrapbox.io/tfrkd-public/Hiroshima.rb_%23058) of the event, he came in late and missed the first two talks though.


## talks

### Methods ending in "ect"

I went first and presented about methods ending in "ect" in Ruby. More about this and the end of this post.

### Clean Code

[Nishimoto-san](https://twitter.com/nishimotz) talked about his new [Safari Subscription](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/). It seems O'Reilly is pushing its customers into Safari subscriptions instead of selling electronic books one by one.

Interestingly, videos are part of the bundle and Nishimoto-san got interested in the [Clean Code videos](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/search/?query=clean+code) made by [Uncle Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin).

Nishimoto-san concluded with a set of good practices he picked up from the videos he viewed so far.

### Elastic Beanstalk

[Ishibashi-san](https://twitter.com/isabisi1484) went next and presented about the Rails application he built and is managing. He showed us how he is deploying them to Elastic Beanstalk and how he is using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) locally for testing those deployments.

Ishibashi-san had already presented about his contact application, but this time the focus was on deployment and management.

### Swift and Ruby

[Guri-san](https://twitter.com/Guri1999120) was attending for the first to Hiroshima.rb, he also attended the RubyKaigi. He's currently studying in a technical university, he talked about the technologies he is using, technologies that are taught to him and the ones he'd like to explore on his own.

He is building a photo sharing application with a Ruby backend and a Swift frontend. I think he mentioned further applications, but I can't remember exactly.

Docker interests him, [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) (shame on me, I think it's the first time I learn about this one), [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and also [Hanami](http://hanamirb.org/) which he discovered during the RubyKaigi.

### Webpacker and Elm

[Adam-san](https://twitter.com/TalAdam) had no slides but he was prepared and made a demonstration of [Webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker#webpacker) (may I say it's a frontend to [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)?).

He went from a bare Rails application, showing the classical [asset pipeline](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html) approach to packaging javascript assets to the Webpacker way.

Adam stepped then into using [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) and entrusting its compliation and packaging to Webpacker. We were all very interested in seeing Elm and noticing its resemblance to [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).

### Favourite Ruby gems

[Furukido-san](https://twitter.com/pecosantoyobe) presented to us a [list of his favourite gems](https://scrapbox.io/tfrkd-public/%E6%9C%80%E8%BF%91%E3%81%A1%E3%82%87%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A8%E3%81%A7%E3%82%82%E8%88%88%E5%91%B3%E3%82%92%E6%8C%81%E3%81%A3%E3%81%9F_gems_2017%E5%B9%B410%E6%9C%88%E5%8F%B7) or at least gems he feels interest for.

I was happy to see [Sequel](http://sequel.jeremyevans.net/) in his list, I had just mentioned it in my talk.

I too share an interest for [Trailblazer](http://trailblazer.to/), I'm looking forward to see where it goes (I had included a link to a part of Trailblazer in my [RubyKaigi talk](http://rubykaigi.org/2017/presentations/jmettraux.html)).

As mentioned above, Furukido-san wrote a [report about this 58th Hiroshima.rb meeting](https://scrapbox.io/tfrkd-public/Hiroshima.rb_%23058).

### Giro di Rubykaigi

At the end of the RubyKaigi, [Ando-san](https://twitter.com/m_ando_japan) and friends organized a cycling tour starting in [Onomichi U2](https://www.onomichi-u2.com/en/). [Mitsuda-san](https://twitter.com/mu2in) was one of the organizers and he presented about his experience of the event.

He showed to us a lot of pictures and explained what happened and who took part cycling.

### Hiroshima Open Seminar 2017

[Takata-san](https://twitter.com/takatayoshitake) had arrived a bit late and ended up talking last.

He reminded us about the upcoming [Open Source Conference 2017](https://www.ospn.jp/osc2017-hiroshima/) in Hiroshima. He showed us the timetable of the conference. It is very crowded, a whole day with four tracks, a real [bazaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar).

It seems there will be a [SciRuby-jp](http://sciruby.com/) talk (about [PyCall](https://github.com/mrkn/pycall.rb) if I remember correctly).


## my talk

I presented about \[some\] methods ending in "etc" in Ruby.

I favour `collect` over `map`, `select` over `find_all`, etc.

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="d9e7715a34e0402a8c81016d403aa2c2" data-ratio="1.33333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

The end of the talk focuses on a \[joke\] Ruby gem named [ect](https://github.com/jmettraux/ect) that adds four "ect" methods to Ruby (well 2 aliases and two trivial methods).

<pre><code class="ruby">class Object

  alias inflect tap

  def deflect
    yield(self)
  end
end

module Enumerable

  alias bisect partition

  def dissect
    inject([]) { |a, elt| (a[yield(elt)] ||= []) << elt; a }
  end
end
</code></pre>

There are usage examples for those four methods in [ect's readme](https://github.com/jmettraux/ect#ect).

Special mention for [Ishibashi-san](https://twitter.com/isabisi1484) who mentioned Ruby's `#respect` method.
