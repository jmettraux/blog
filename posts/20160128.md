## familiarity

> A man should avoid displaying deep familiarity with any subject. Can one
> imagine a well-bred man talking with the airs of a know-it-all, even about a
> matter with which he is in fact familiar? ... It is impressive when a man is
> always slow to speak, even on subjects he knows thoroughly, and does not speak
> at all unless questioned.
