## rufus-scheduler 3.3.0 released

I have just released [rufus-scheduler](https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler) [3.3.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/rufus-scheduler/versions/3.3.0).

Rufus-scheduler is a job scheduling (at, in, every, cron) library available as a [Ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/rufus-scheduler). It is not meant as a cron replacement, it lives within the Ruby process using it and dies with it.

Why the jump from 3.2.x to 3.3.x? It's because of a mistake I made: I was relying on `ENV['TZ']` to get timezoned Time instances. It works fine and cuts the dependency on the [tzinfo gem](https://github.com/tzinfo/tzinfo), but when you're working with multiple threads and one is setting `ENV['TZ']` to `Europe/Helsinki` while another is setting it to `America/Houston`, both might end up with Time instances in Houston or Helsinki. Chaos.

This rufus-scheduler 3.3.0 brings back the tzinfo dependency and uses it to support its `Rufus::Scheduler::ZoTime` class. Instances of ZoTime quack like if they were Ruby Time instances but keep their zone as an instance of `TZInfo::TimeZone`.

Should problems appear after an upgrade to 3.3.0, please fill a clear and detailed issue at [https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler/issues](https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler/issues).

This `ENV['TZ']` problem was pointed out ([gh-220](https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler/issues/220)) by [Musha Akinori](https://github.com/knu). Many thanks to him!

A new feature made it into this 3.3.0, it was requested/contributed by [Piavka](https://github.com/piavka) in [gh-214](https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler/issues/214). It's a `Rufus::Scheduler::Job#trigger_off_schedule` method. It lets you trigger a job, off of its schedule. If, during the off schedule run, the job is started "in schedule", overlap settings kick in. Off-schedule or in-schedule, calls to `Job#running?` will return true. It has its uses with repeat jobs.

This release also contains two fixes. One for `.parse_to_time` vs `Date` instances ([gh-216](https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler/issues/216)), thanks to [Nicol√°s Satragno](http://satragno.com). And one for "day 0 cronlines" ([gh-221](https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler/issues/221)), thanks to [Ramon Tayag](https://github.com/ramontayag).

Thanks again.
