I was approached on Twitter by [Benjamin Dauvergne](https://twitter.com/b_dauvergne), he asked: "Will we some day have a blog post about the design of ruote/flor? :)".

He then expanded to "Or pointers about inspiration, I have trouble understanding the expression/message executor, it looks like a [tuplespace/whiteboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple_space) design".

I pointed at [flor's nascent documentation](https://github.com/floraison/flor/tree/master/doc), but, well, that isn't a blog post, it's an index, not a gate.

Let me try to answer.

Benjamin, please ask any further question you have directly to me on Twitter, like you did. I'll do my best to answer, possibly in a further blog post.

### workflow engine design

Ruote and flor were/are meant to be workflow engines. Workflow as in decomposition of a work into a set of tasks sequential and or concurrent. Engine because they are meant to give an impetus to the flow.

Maybe workflow "driver" would be better. Flor reads an itinerary called a workflow definition and drives according to it.

### ruote design

Ruote is the descendant of a dead workflow engine written in Java and called OpenWFE.

Here is a sample process definition for that Java workflow engine, yes, it's XML:
<pre><code class="xml">&lt;sequence>
  &lt;participant name="alice" task="do this" />
  &lt;concurrence>
    &lt;participant name="bob" task="do that" />
    &lt;participant name="charly" task="do this again" />
  &lt;concurrence>
&lt;sequence>
</code></pre>

Ruote could read that original format, and after a few iterations, it could read a Ruby DSL (or internal DSL) in which, the above could be written as:

<pre><code class="ruby">sequence do
  participant 'name' => 'alice', 'task' => 'do this'
  concurrence do
    participant 'name' => 'bob', 'task' => 'do that'
    participant 'name' => 'charly', 'task' => 'do this again'
  end
end
</code></pre>

XML is wonderful, but is it a good support for a would-be scripting language?

TODO limitation of language, XML then Ruby DSL
TODO ruote and "expressions"
TODO Lisp and abstract syntax trees
TODO Jython and Perl envy

All of those lines were called in OpenWFE and ruote "expressions".

### flor design

Flor hasn't got half a dozen adapters, it assumes the storage is behind a [Sequel](http://sequel.jeremyevans.net/) dataset. That's another way to focus, less to maintain for me.
