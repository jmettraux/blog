## released rufus-scheduler 3.2.0

I have just released [rufus-scheduler](https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler) [3.2.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/rufus-scheduler/versions/3.2.0).

Rufus-scheduler is a job scheduling (at, in, every, cron) library available as a Ruby gem. It is not meant as a cron replacement, it lives within the Ruby process using it and dies with it.

The switch from 3.1.x to 3.2.x is motivated by the [change worked on with @Korrigan](https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler/pull/181). "every" schedules now more carefully stick to their "@next_time".

There is also a little bit of caching that got added to CronLine to prevent computing frequencies [again and again](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34446354) when scheduling cron jobs.

Happy new year!
