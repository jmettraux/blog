## yahoo proxy with python

I am not a Python programmer, but I participated to [last night SugoiHiroshima](https://great-h.connpass.com/event/60306/) ([#すごい広島](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23%E3%81%99%E3%81%94%E3%81%84%E5%BA%83%E5%B3%B6)) and I had brought with me a deck of slides about a small proxy to Yahoo Finance that I wrote as a [toy example](https://github.com/jmettraux/yapy).

At the end of the deck, I'm giving pointers to [12factor.net](https://12factor.net) [/ja/](https://12factor.net/ja/), [runit](http://smarden.org/runit) and providing a quick configuration example for a [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) reverse proxy to put in front of that service.
