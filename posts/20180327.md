## fugit 1.1.0 released

I'm working on a newer version of [Rufus-Scheduler](https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler), it'll probably be a 3.5.x.

Two important things behind rufus-scheduler are Time instances with time zones, this is provided by [et-orbi](https://github.com/floraison/et-orbi) and the parsing of time strings which is provided by [fugit](https://github.com/floraison/fugit).

<pre><code class="ruby">require 'fugit'

Fugit.parse('0 0 1 jan *').class         # ==> ::Fugit::Cron
Fugit.parse('12y12M').class              # ==> ::Fugit::Duration

Fugit.parse('2017-12-12').class          # ==> ::EtOrbi::EoTime
Fugit.parse('2017-12-12 UTC').class      # ==> ::EtOrbi::EoTime

Fugit.parse('every day at noon').class   # ==> ::Fugit::Cron
</code></pre>

Fugit understands cron strings, duration strings, and points in time. They are parsed to instances of, respectively, `Fugit::Cron`, `Fugit::Duration`, and `EtOrbi::EoTime` (the Time instance provided by et-orbi).

The fugit cron class provides methods for determining next or previous time and if a point in time matches.

<pre><code class="ruby">require 'fugit'

c = Fugit::Cron.parse('0 0 * *  sun')
  # or
c = Fugit::Cron.new('0 0 * *  sun')

p Time.now  # => 2017-01-03 09:53:27 +0900

p c.next_time      # => 2017-01-08 00:00:00 +0900
p c.previous_time  # => 2017-01-01 00:00:00 +0900

p c.match?(Time.parse('2017-08-06'))  # => true
p c.match?(Time.parse('2017-08-07'))  # => false
p c.match?('2017-08-06')              # => true
p c.match?('2017-08-06 12:00')        # => false
</code></pre>

Fugit understands the standard cron format (5 entries) and also an extended format with seconds (6 entries).

The release of this 1.1.0 is a motivated by [a request](https://github.com/floraison/fugit/issues/2) from the authors of [que-scheduler](https://github.com/hlascelles/que-scheduler) to support cron strings with timezones.

I was busy on other ([floraison](https://github.com/floraison)) things and I had forgotten to work on cron strings with timezones. They are necessary, since rufus-scheduler understands them. Fugit has to master them to become the basis of future rufus-scheduler releases.
