## rufus-scheduler 3.6.0 released

The [last Ruby Weekly](https://rubyweekly.com/issues/446) contained a pointer to [Resque-Scheduler](https://rubyweekly.com/link/62438/web) in its "Code & Tools" section. I was a bit intrigued, it's been years since Ruby Weekly reposted anything I pushed to [RubyFlow](http://www.rubyflow.com) about rufus-scheduler (or its dependencies like fugit).

[Resque-Scheduler](https://github.com/resque/resque-scheduler) was the first project to combine [Resque](https://github.com/resque/resque) and rufus-scheduler. When [Sidekiq](https://sidekiq.org/) rose, [sideqik-scheduler](https://github.com/moove-it/sidekiq-scheduler) and [sideqik-cron](https://github.com/ondrejbartas/sidekiq-cron) appeared.

I was happy to see the embargo somehow worked around and a project using some of my work being showcased.

I haven't had a look at Resque-Scheduler in ages. I looked at the issues and found [one quite recent](https://github.com/resque/resque-scheduler/issues/649) that could be addressed by me, as a dependency provider.

It has two parts:

* Invalid cron strings were failing at schedule time as expected, but the message was not helping at all, [fugit#19](https://github.com/floraison/fugit/issues/19)
* Somehow older versions of rufus-scheduler were accepting `"/15 * * * *"` but newer versions, based on fugit do not, [rufus-scheduler#289](https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler/issues/289)

I fixed both issues and released [rufus-scheduler 3.6.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/rufus-scheduler) and [fugit 1.2.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/fugit).

I used to say "build it and they will complain", but sometimes, you have to dig to find the those complaints.
