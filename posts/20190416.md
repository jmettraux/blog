## reddit answer on workflow engines

Here is an answer I wrote for [go to resource on how to build a workflow engine](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/aextsp/go_to_resource_on_how_to_build_a_workflow_engine/).

Robert was asking:
> So I'm researching how to build a workflow engine, is there like a "standard work" or "go to resource" for this topic? Just starting out, will keep a log here.

That makes for a cheap blog post, but I'd like to keep that as an archive.

### my answer

I built three workflow engines over the years. I have never found a "how to
build a workflow engine" resource, but I found workflow engines (all of them
proprietary when I started), research papers about workflow modelling, budding
industry standards, and blogs.

My idea of a workflow engine, then and now, was of a tool that accepts a
model of a business process (a workflow definition), something rather high-level
describing the flow of work among participants to produce a business result.
The developers and the business people should be able to gather around such a
document and agree on it (later on, iterate on it to adapt to new situations).

The document/model/piece of code should rally business logic, instead of having
it scattered all over the place.

For the two last engines I built, I used the [Workflow Patterns](http://www.workflowpatterns.com/)
to guide me, more specifically, the [Control-Flow Patterns](http://www.workflowpatterns.com/patterns/control/). A workflow engine, in my opinion, has to cover the principal
patterns listed there to be of any use.

Another resource I came to appreciate, is [BPMN](http://www.bpmn.org/). It's a
business process model and notation. It is mostly used to document business
processes and a subset of it is destined for "execution". I have seen
organizations use BPMN to document "manual" business processes "as is", and
sometimes to model business processes for execution by a workflow engine "to be".

BPMN is important because more business people are getting exposed to it. They
are attracted like flies to the promise of drawing executable diagrams.
Ten years ago, the buzzword was "no code". But then, recently, it became
"low code". It's hard to abstract away the programming.

My favourite blog about BPMN and its surroundings is
[Process Is The Main Thing](http://mainthing.ru/).

It might be necessary to look the series of blog posts culminating in
[Business Process Models are Not Agile](https://social-biz.org/2019/03/29/business-process-models-are-not-agile/#more-4798) for a rebuttal of the grail of business process
modelling.

It seems that many times, a box and arrow system is too top-down to succeed.
It'd be better to have a kind of task list with termination and delegation
rules/constraints, and tracing. The balance is yours to find.

A task / worklist system at the front, with a workflow engine behind driving
some of the non-loose business processes might make a good combination. When
building task lists I tend to look at [Workflow Resource Patterns](http://www.workflowpatterns.com/patterns/resource/),
the resource subset of the patterns mentioned above.

You could start with a tasklist and as the time passes, iterate towards having
the repetitive task patterns codified into business processes, cataloged in
a process portfolio, itself iterating as the business conditions evolve.

You will also come across the term "workflow engine", but that'll cover scientific
workflow engines as well, those are more specialized into the process of data
workflows. From the other answers here, I guess you are more interested into
"business process" engines. Googling for "Ruby workflow" will lead you in
world of development techniques.

So, the resources I have found and used are mostly about what to build, not
how to build it. As a programmer, my customers usually tell me what to build
and the how to is for me to figure.

My two Ruby workflow engines are [ruote](http://ruote.io/) which is now dead,
and its successor [flor](https://github.com/floraison/flor). They are web
framework agnostic. For the task/worklist companion to flor, I am building
[florist](https://github.com/floraison/florist).

In the flor readme, you'll find a [list](https://github.com/floraison/flor#other-ruby-projects-about-workflows) of other Ruby (and Rails) workflow
engines.
