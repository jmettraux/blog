## programmer arrogance

My friend said to me: "to tell you the truth, I've never met a programmer who'd tell me good things about what another programmer did".

He went further: "I had hired a young developer to make a tool for me. It was a continuous struggle to make him accept our needs over the needs he 'envisioned' for the tool. Each of his defeats were punctuated by a warning and an arrogant grin".
