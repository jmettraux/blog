## vim :ListOld

_The initial version of this post was about a `ListOld` function. After a few days, I changed my mind about it and rewrote as `ListFiles`, including current buffers and recently opened files in a single "view". The original post is [still visible](https://github.com/jmettraux/blog/blob/0c1466d4512f8b563948011c6c06c55e49dfe112/posts/20160222.md)._

I use [Vim](http://www.vim.org) as my main text editor. It's ubiquitous. I have a minimal [.vim/](https://github.com/jmettraux/dotvim) setup. It moves around with me easily, as long as I have ssh and git, I can get comfortable on a host very quickly.

I needed a way to access the most recently updated files. `:bro old` is painful to use.

Here is a vimscript function that pipes the output of `:bro old` in a file then lets you roam in it with `j` and `k` and then hit `<space>` to open a file. Use the standard `ctrl-6` or `ctrl-^` to get back in the file list.

It also outputs the result of `:buffers`, so you're presented with a list of currently open buffers followed by a list of recently opened files. I find it convenient for quickly navigating or getting back into context.

<pre><code class="vim">function! s:ListFiles()

  exe 'silent bwipeout ==ListFiles'
    " close previous ListFiles if any

  exe 'new | only'
    " | only makes it full window
  exe 'file ==ListFiles'
    " replace buffer name
  exe 'setlocal buftype=nofile'
  exe 'setlocal bufhidden=hide'
  exe 'setlocal noswapfile'
  exe 'setlocal nobuflisted'

  exe 'redir @z'
  exe 'silent echo "== recent"'
  exe 'silent echo ""'
  exe 'silent bro ol'
  exe 'redir END'
  exe 'silent 0put z'
    " list recently opened files, put at top

  exe 'redir @y'
  exe 'silent echo "== buffers"'
  exe 'silent echo ""'
  exe 'silent buffers'
  exe 'redir END'
  exe 'silent 0put y'
    " list currently open buffers, put at top

  exe '%s/^\s\+\d\+[^\"]\+"//'
  exe '%s/"\s\+line /:/'
  exe 'g/^Type number and /d'
  exe 'g/COMMIT_EDITMSG/d'
  exe 'g/NetrwTreeListing/d'
  exe 'silent %s/^[0-9]\+: //'
    " remove unnecessary lines and ensure format {filepath}:{linenumber}

  call feedkeys('1Gjj')
    " position just above the first buffer, if any

  setlocal syntax=listold
    " syntax highlight as per ~/.vim/syntax/listold.vim

  nmap &lt;buffer> o gF
  nmap &lt;buffer> &lt;space> gF
  nmap &lt;buffer> &lt;CR> gF
    "
    " hitting o, space or return opens the file under the cursor
    " just for the current buffer

endfunction

command! -nargs=0 ListFiles :call &lt;SID>ListFiles()
nnoremap &lt;silent> &lt;leader>b :call &lt;SID>ListFiles()<CR>
  "
  " when I hit ";b" it shows my list
</code></pre>

The original is at [https://github.com/jmettraux/dotvim/blob/fe1d1c3f/vimrc#L346-L390](https://github.com/jmettraux/dotvim/blob/fe1d1c3f/vimrc#L346-L390).

Here is an example output:

<img src="images/20160222_vim.png" class="screenshot" style="width: 77%" />

I move up and down with `k` and `j` and hit `space` to open the file under the cursor. I hit `ctrl-6` (`;;` in my setting) to get back to the list of files.

I also added:
<pre><code class="bash">alias vo='vim -c "ListFiles"'
</code></pre>
to my `.bashrc` so that `vo` fires up Vim directly in this list of files.

This script is condensed from a series of google searches and stackoverflow scans. I felt like quitting in the middle, but there is always an answer somewhere that unlocks it all.
