## vim :ListOld

I use [vim](http://www.vim.org) as my main text editor. It's ubiquitous. I have a minimal [.vim/](https://github.com/jmettraux/dotvim) setup. It moves around with me easily.

I needed a way to access the most recently updated files. `:bro old` is painful to use.

Here is a vimscript function that pipes the output of `:bro old` in a file then lets you roam in it with `j` and `k` and then hit `<space>` to open a file. Use the standard `ctrl-6` or `ctrl-^` to get back in the file list.

<pre><code class="vim">function! s:ListOld()

  let fn = tempname() . '.listold'
  exe 'e ' . fn
    "
    " create and enter temporary file

  exe 'redir @z'
  exe 'silent bro ol'
  exe 'redir END'
  exe 'put=@z'
    "
    " run `bro ol` and pipe its result into the `z` register
    " paste the content of the register in our file

  exe '%s/^[0-9]\+: //'
    "
    " remove the file numbers at the head of the lines

  exe 'g/^[^0-9]/d'
  exe 'g/^$/d'
  exe 'g/^[^~]/d'
  exe 'g/EDITMSG/d'
  exe 'g/NetrwTreeListing/d'
    "
    " remove unnecessary lines

  setlocal syntax=listold
    "
    " activate `listold` syntax

  call feedkeys("1GO^M== ListOld^M^[j")
  call feedkeys(":w^M")
    "
    " add '== ListOld' header

  nmap &lt;buffer> o gF
  nmap &lt;buffer> &lt;space> gF
  nmap &lt;buffer> &lt;CR> gF
    "
    " hitting o, space or return opens the file under the cursor
    " just for the current buffer

endfunction

"command! -nargs=0 ListOld :call &lt;SID>ListOld()
nnoremap &lt;silent> &lt;leader>o :call &lt;SID>ListOld()<CR>
  "
  " when I hit ";o" it lists the recently used files...

Here is an example output:

<img src="images/20160222_vim.png" class="screenshot" style="width: 49%" />

I move up and down with `k` and `j` and hit `space` to open the file under the cursor. I hit `ctrl-6` (`;;` in my setting) to get back to the list of files.

This script is condensed from a series of google searches and stackoverflow scans. I felt like quitting in the middle, but there is always an answer somewhere that unlocks it all.
