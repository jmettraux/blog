## rufus-scheduler 3.2.1 released

I've just released [rufus-scheduler](https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler) [3.2.1](https://rubygems.org/gems/rufus-scheduler/versions/3.2.1).

Rufus-scheduler is a Ruby gem for scheduling pieces of code. You instantiate a scheduler and you tell it after how long you want a block of code to run or how often you want it to run.

<pre><code class="ruby">require 'rufus-scheduler'

scheduler = Rufus::Scheduler.new

scheduler.in '3h' do
  # do something in 3 hours
end

scheduler.at '2030/12/12 23:30:00' do
  # do something at a given point in time
end

scheduler.every '3h' do
  # do something every 3 hours
end

scheduler.cron '5 0 * * *' do
  # do something every day, five minutes after midnight
  # (see "man 5 crontab" in your terminal)
end

scheduler.join
  # let the current thread join the scheduler thread
</code></pre>

This [3.2.1 release](https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler/blob/8af6702b3b98b02ae569a305d3fd75d6c9cfe67a/CHANGELOG.txt#L5-L11) mostly brings negative weekdays to cron strings. It lets you write crons like:

<pre><code class="ruby">require 'rufus-scheduler'

scheduler = Rufus::Scheduler.new

scheduler.cron '5 0 * * 5L' do
  # do something every last Friday of the month, at 00:05
end

scheduler.cron '5 0 * * 4#-2,4#-1' do
  # do something every second to last and last Thursday of the month, at 00:05
end
  #
  # or
  #
scheduler.cron '5 0 * * thu#-2,thu#-1' do
  # do something every second to last and last Thursday of the month, at 00:05
end

scheduler.join
</code></pre>
