## Guns, Germs, and Steel

Up until now, I used to post the cover of the books I completed on Instagram.

From now on, I will post them here, in this classical blog. A friend told me I was an ass for posting book covers on Instagram, potentially making friends and family (almost 100% of my Instagram followers) angry at my prententiousness.

OK, so that was a fun ride. I'll post here instead. Almost nobody reads this blog, so I'm safe and I can focus on my book timeline goal. What did I read, when and what quote I could snapshot out of it.

### Guns, and Roses

East-West, North-South, geographical partitions. I had to read [it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns,_Germs,_and_Steel).

In the reading list, this book points at [The Descent of Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Descent_of_Man,_and_Selection_in_Relation_to_Sex) and [Before the Dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_the_Dawn_(book)).
