## Hail to the King Arduin

### connecting

I got an Arduino Nano clone for ~ USD 3.5 and attempted to connect it to my OSX Yosemite laptop.

At first, no lights, my micro-USB cable was dead. Found another one and the Nano lit up.

But the Arduino IDE was not seeing the board. I was only seeing the USB modem serial ports in the selection.

After various tries downloading and installing the ch34X driver, I could talk with the board, but had random kernel panics.

I finally came across this [Github project](https://github.com/adrianmihalko/ch340g-ch34g-ch34x-mac-os-x-driver) with a patched version of the driver. The project says "Sierra", but I tried the advertised:

<pre style="font-size: 80%"><code class="bash">$ brew tap mengbo/ch340g-ch34g-ch34x-mac-os-x-driver https://github.com/mengbo/ch340g-ch34g-ch34x-mac-os-x-driver
$ brew cask install wch-ch34x-usb-serial-driver
</code></pre>

and it then worked flawlessly on my Yosemite OSX, with the `cu.wchusbserial1410` that appears when the Nano board is connected.

### developping

The Arduino IDE is nice and all, it provides access to a wealth of libraries and example, but a [Vim](/?tag=vim) person like me was soon feeling slowed by the editor.

You still need the Arduino IDE around, but you can use an [Arduino-Makefile](https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile) to stay in the command line.

At first, I tried to work with this Makefile following in the instructions behind the [link](http://hardwarefun.com/tutorials/compiling-arduino-sketches-using-makefile) in the project description, but that was an error.

Following the project [readme](https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile/blob/master/README.md) is the path to the success.

<pre style="font-size: 80%"><code class="bash">$ brew tap sudar/arduino-mk
$ brew install arduino-mk

$ pip install pyserial
</code></pre>

Then I included a link to the template makefile

<pre><code class="makefile">ARDUINO_DIR:=/Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Java
ARDMK_DIR:=/usr/local/opt/arduino-mk
AVR_TOOLS_DIR:=$(ARDUINO_DIR)/hardware/tools/avr
MONITOR_PORT:=/dev/cu.wchusbserial1410
BOARD_TAG:=nano
BOARD_SUB:=atmega328

include /usr/local/opt/arduino-mk/Arduino.mk
</code></pre>

I wrote my `serial_blink.ino` thus

<pre><code class="cpp">
const unsigned int LED_PIN = 13;
const unsigned int BAUD_RATE = 9600;

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(BAUD_RATE);
}

void loop() {
  if ( ! Serial.available() > 0) return;
  int c = Serial.read();
  if (c == '0') {
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);
  }
  else if (c == '1') {
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);
  }
}
</code></pre>

and uploaded it with `make upload`, hit the serial console with `make monitor` and was able to turn the LED on with a `1` and off with a `0`.

My small start project is at [https://github.com/jmettraux/serial_blink](https://github.com/jmettraux/serial_blink).
