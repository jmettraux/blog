## Gemfile.lock

If you are responsible for an application, a last-mile application, not a library (a gem), please check in your Gemfile.lock.

I recently released [rufus-scheduler 3.5.0](20180515.html?t=gemfile_lock) and it was quiet, a few new stars, no comments [on RubyFlow](http://www.rubyflow.com/p/7x7dbj-rufus-scheduler-350-released-fugit-time-parsing). [Ruby Weekly](https://rubyweekly.com/) did not pick up the release in its announcement, so I thought I was free to focus on other things.

A couple of days later, I got notified on GitHub, people were posting on an old, closed, [sidekiq-cron](https://github.com/ondrejbartas/sidekiq-cron) issue:

<a href="https://github.com/ondrejbartas/sidekiq-cron/issues/12#issuecomment-389812971"><img src="images/20180601_sc12.png" style="width: 84%;"></a>

Great, if the API had changed, I would have been glad to release as 4.0.0 instead of 3.5.0, but since sidekiq-cron currently [depends](https://github.com/ondrejbartas/sidekiq-cron/blob/40f179f6aa87c7d52034b3cf781b80929e5d72a8/Gemfile#L4) on rufus-scheduler `>= 3.3.0`, sidekiq-cron would still be "not scheduling".

The problem was again reported in two more issues, [#199](https://github.com/ondrejbartas/sidekiq-cron/issues/199) and [#201](https://github.com/ondrejbartas/sidekiq-cron/issues/201), it also just found its way on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50625601/sidekiqcronjob-throw-me-uninitialized-constant-rufusschedulercronline-er).

How is the concern voiced?

> I have been using sidekiq-cron successfully over the past few months, now it stopped working overnight. [#201](https://github.com/ondrejbartas/sidekiq-cron/issues/201)

and

> Suddenly all of our cron jobs were not being enqueued anymore [#199](https://github.com/ondrejbartas/sidekiq-cron/issues/199#issuecomment-391847268)

OK, so suddenly it stopped working? You didn't check in your Gemfile.lock, that's what you're exposing yourself to.

It saddens me to see that everybody jumps at the "let's depend on rufus-scheduler 3.4 in our Gemfile" [pseudo-solution](https://github.com/moonavw/labman/commit/e13dd40632ebd94054d64af8014c11b675fac1d9). It might be necessary for new integrations of sideqik-cron, but for "running" deploys, it's poor practice.

If you are responsible for an application, a last-mile application, not a library/gem, please check in your Gemfile.lock, [it is meant](https://bundler.io/v1.16/guides/updating_gems.html) to protect you from that kind of problems.

Updating your dependency gem versions is something you do deliberately, with your back covered by your test suite.

(please note that I submitted a pull request to sidekiq-cron to [rework](https://github.com/ondrejbartas/sidekiq-cron/pull/200) the sidekiq-cron to rufus-scheduler dependency)
