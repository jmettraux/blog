## L'Effroyable Trag√©die

<img src="images/20180626_tragedie.jpg" style="width: 28%; float: right; padding-left: 1em;" />

It's a book in french, I'll anyway write about it in english.

Here are a few things I take from the book:

- As Napoleon was a warning for Hitler, Napoleon had the [Charles XII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_invasion_of_Russia_(1708%E2%80%931709)) warning.

- The [Berezina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Berezina) crossing featured a diversion at Baryssaw, but the troops crossed at Stoudianka.

- The Russian army too suffered heavily from the winter cold, especially as they stretched westward.
