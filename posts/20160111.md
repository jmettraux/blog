## banausic occupations

> Very good, Critobulus; for to be sure, the so-called banausic occupations
> are scorned and, naturally enough, held in low regard in our states. For they
> spoil the bodies of the workmen and the foremen, forcing them to sit still
> and stay indoors, and in some cases to spend the whole day by the fire.
> As their bodies become womanish their souls lose strength too. Moreover,
> these so-called banausic occupations leave no spare time for attention to
> one's friend and city, so that those who follow them are reputed bad at
> dealing with friends and bad defenders of their country.

Socrates to Critobulus in Xenophon's Oeconomicus (3.15-4.3)
