## Before the Dawn

After reading [Guns, Germs, and Steel](20180509.html?t=guns_germs_and_steel&from=before_the_dawn), I had to read [Before the Dawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_the_Dawn_(book)).

I liked it a lot. It was an easier read than Guns, Germs, and Steel. They feel complementary to me.

Each chapter of this book begins with a Charles Darwin [The Descent of Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Descent_of_Man,_and_Selection_in_Relation_to_Sex) quote, it makes me want to read this particular book even more, but I have to admit that I am tempted by [Tristram Shandy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_and_Opinions_of_Tristram_Shandy,_Gentleman) these days. Or should I re-read [The Red Queen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Queen:_Sex_and_the_Evolution_of_Human_Nature)?
