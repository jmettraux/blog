## flor verticals

[flor](https://github.com/floraison/flor), as a workflow engine, cares about routing work between participants.

<pre><code class="python">sequence
  alice 'do this'
  bob 'do that'
  charly 'do that other thing'
</code></pre>

What goes around between the steps in the workflow is a workitem. It's mostly a [JSON](https://json.org) object like this one:

<pre><code class="javascript">{ point: "task",
  exid: "test-u_taskapp-20190303.0936.dujopufibi",
  nid: "0", from: "0",
  payload: { amount: [ "USD", 20000 ], ret: [ 123, 456, 789 ] },
  tasker: "alice", taskname: "do this",
  attl: [ "alice" ], attd: {},
  tags: [], var: null }
</code></pre>

For the participants in a workflow execution, the most important piece is the "payload":
<pre><code class="javascript">payload: { amount: [ "USD", 20000 ], ret: [ 123, 456, 789 ] }
</code></pre>

Participants are expected to perform their task based on the information found in the payload (attl, attd, tags and vars may help too). Usually they add to the payload and give back the workitem for the execution to resume.

As seen above, there is usually a ret: entry in the payload. It's the return value of the previous procedure/step, so that:
<pre><code class="python">+ 1 2 3
</code></pre>
yields a ret of `6`.

Many of the [flor procedures](https://github.com/floraison/flor/tree/master/doc/procedures#procedures) can be used with an "incoming" payload ret, and thus be chained like in:
<pre><code class="python">sequence
  [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 ]
  select
    = (elt % 2) 1
  collect
    * elt 2
  + _
  # yields 18
</code></pre>

or

<pre><code class="python">sequence
  alice 'establish list of applications'
  c-each f.application_id
    specialist 'evaluate application'
  select application_id
    = f.results[application_id].stalled
  c-each f.application_id
    specialist 'unstall application'
</code></pre>
