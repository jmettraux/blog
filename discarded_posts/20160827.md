## maker nightmares

* Building a sand castle is not generating nightmares
* Although building and rebuilding a sand castle is a sisyphean nightmare
* A nightmare might be born because you built something, and being faillible, you know something might (will) go wrong

* Building something that requires careful testing of multiple paths is nightmare-generating

* Avoid building nightmare generators
* Or build things that fail fast, are easy to repair, where failure is contained
* Communicate about your faillibility, about the unknows
* The reward might be some teaching, some extra brain power, the loan of another point of view

* Too many point of view, have to carefully prune, spare your brain power (especially if it's in tight supply)
